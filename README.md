# Smart-Timer
Timer full stack web app to track my productivity. 

Inspired by POMODORO technique, I wanted to track my timer quality.

Not every session is focused, so this web app should track the type of activity I do and the quality of it.

- [x] HTML/CSS/JS frontend
- [x] GCP App-Engine backend 
- [x] Backend is NodeJS with Express framework

Still a work in progress.

I am noting down my ideas and issues here https://github.com/Nikhil0487/Smart-Timer/projects/2
